      <p>Usage:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Load all the images for the chapter (might take a few seconds to load!)</li>
        <li>Set an appropriate name prefix (optional)</li>
        <li>Move rulers around to mark page boundaries you want to split at. You can add and delete rulers with the floating buttons next to them.</li>
        <li>Check if you're happy with the page sizes on the right side.</li>
        <li>When you're happy with the breaks, press Download, and save all the files. This will take a few seconds, and might even crash your browser if you don't have enough RAM!</li>
        <li>If not all files got downloaded (chrome should ask about multiple downloads), you can manually download the individual pages.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Good luck! Bug tobaccoroad#5946 on Discord with bugs or if you can help with UX / CSS!</p>
